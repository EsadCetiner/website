    [ModSecurity](https://www.modsecurity.org/) is an open source, cross-platform web application firewall (WAF) module. 
    Known as the "Swiss Army Knife" of WAFs, it enables web application defenders to gain 
    visibility into HTTP(S) traffic and provides a power rules language and API to implement 
    advanced protections.
