  REQUEST-900-EXCLUSION-RULES-BEFORE-CRS.conf.example: >
    This file is used to add LOCAL exceptions for your site. Often in this file
    we would see rules that short-circuit inspection and allow certain
    transactions to skip through inspection.
    
    `Example: SecRule REMOTE_ADDR "@ipMatch 192.168.1.100" "phase:1,id:'981033',t:none,nolog,pass,ctl:ruleEngine=Off"`
  REQUEST-901-INITIALIZATION.conf: TODO
  REQUEST-913-SCANNER-DETECTION.conf: >
    These rules are concentrated around detecting security tools and
    scanners.
  REQUEST-920-PROTOCOL-ENFORCEMENT.conf: >
    The rules in this file center around detecting requests that either
    violate HTTP or represent a request that no modern browser would
    generate, for instance missing a user-agent.
  REQUEST-921-PROTOCOL-ATTACK.conf: >
    The rules in this file focus on specific attacks against the HTTP
    protocol itself such as HTTP Request Smuggling and Response Splitting.
  REQUEST-930-APPLICATION-ATTACK-LFI.conf: >
    These rules attempt to detect when a user is trying to include a file
    that would be local to the webserver that they should not have access
    to. Exploiting this type of attack can lead to the web application or
    server being compromised.
  REQUEST-931-APPLICATION-ATTACK-RFI.conf: >
    These rules attempt to detect when a user is trying to include a
    remote resource into the web application that will be executed.
    Exploiting this type of attack can lead to the web application or
    server being compromised.

  REQUEST-941-APPLICATION-ATTACK-XSS.conf: TODO
  REQUEST-942-APPLICATION-ATTACK-SQLI.conf: >
    Within this configuration file we provide rules that protect against
    SQL injection attacks. SQLi attackers occur when an attacker passes
    crafted control characters to parameters to an area of the application
    that is expecting only data. The application will then pass the
    control characters to the database. This will end up changing the
    meaning of the expected SQL query.
  REQUEST-943-APPLICATION-ATTACK-SESSION-FIXATION.conf: >
    These rules focus around providing protection against Session Fixation
    attacks.
  REQUEST-944-APPLICATION-ATTACK-JAVA.conf: TODO
  REQUEST-949-BLOCKING-EVALUATION.conf: >
    These rules provide the anomaly based blocking for a given request. If
    you are in anomaly detection mode this file must not be deleted.
  RESPONSE-950-DATA-LEAKAGES.conf:
    These rules provide protection against data leakages that may occur
    genericly
  RESPONSE-951-DATA-LEAKAGES-SQL.conf: >
    These rules provide protection against data leakages that may occur
    from backend SQL servers. Often these are indicative of SQL injection
    issues being present.
  RESPONSE-952-DATA-LEAKAGES-JAVA.conf: >
    These rules provide protection against data leakages that may occur
    because of Java
  RESPONSE-953-DATA-LEAKAGES-PHP.conf: >
    These rules provide protection against data leakages that may occur
    because of PHP
  RESPONSE-954-DATA-LEAKAGES-IIS.conf: >
    These rules provide protection against data leakages that may occur
    because of Microsoft IIS.
  RESPONSE-959-BLOCKING-EVALUATION.conf: >
    These rules provide the anomaly based blocking for a given response.
    If you are in anomaly detection mode this file must not be deleted.
  RESPONSE-980-CORRELATION.conf: >
    The rules in this configuration file facilitate the gathering of data
    about successful and unsuccessful attacks on the server.
  RESPONSE-999-EXCLUSION-RULES-AFTER-CRS.conf.example: >
    This file is used to add LOCAL exceptions for your site. Often in this
    file we would see rules that short-circuit inspection and allow
    certain transactions to skip through inspection.
