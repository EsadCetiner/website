The landmark [transfer](https://owasp.org/blog/2024/01/09/ModSecurity.html) of ModSecurity custodianship to OWASP promises 
to inject fresh energy and perspectives into this 
project. OWASPâ€™s vast network of security experts and volunteers can now directly contribute to the project's core. 
This powerful WAF is poised to further solidify its position as a cornerstone of web application security, 
protecting countless websites against the ever-evolving threat landscape. 

We, as an industry, can all stand to benefit from this open-source collaboration, empowering developers, 
and security professionals alike to build and maintain safer applications in the years to come. 
OWASP calls all interested parties to join hands and help with the future development of ModSecurity.
